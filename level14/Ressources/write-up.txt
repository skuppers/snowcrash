# As we logged in, we don't see any files in the home directory that peek out.
# So we searched for files with special permissions, checked running processes, services, network sockets, cron jobs, but we found nothing.
# So we decided to reverse engineer the getflag binary with cutter.
# Right at the start we found the string which corresponds to the level 14.
# But it is encrypted using the ft_des function. So we copied the entire function, rewrote it to understand it better, and added a main function to pass the first argument to ft_des and print the result. TA-DA!
