#As we login we were prompted that we got mail, so we looked into
/var/mail/level05. The content of the mail was a crontab command. We put the
command in the crontab for the flag05 user.
We understood that the command is executing every files placed in /opt/openarenaserver.
#We then put a script there to run getflag
and write the output to a file that we had access to in /tmp/level05.
#Don't forget to chmod +x the script.
