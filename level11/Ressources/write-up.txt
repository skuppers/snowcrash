# As we open the lua script we see the io.popen call which executes the code
inside it.
# we also see that it concatenates the user's password to the command to execute.
# So simply type connect to the server with
# nc localhost 5151
# And type `getflag > /tmp/level11/flag` as password.
# And read the flag from the /tmp/level11/flag file.
