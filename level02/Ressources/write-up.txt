#We found the .pcap file, which stands for "packet capture". We copied that file
locally and loaded it in wireshark. Where we followed the tcp_stream, which
allow us to only see the sent packets. We then saw the line with
"ft_wandr...NDRel.LOL". The dots were "7F", which is the ascii code for "DEL" so
after redoing the user input, we found the password to log into flag02:
"ft_waNDReL0L".
